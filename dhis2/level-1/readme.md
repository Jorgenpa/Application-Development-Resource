### Applications To Build:
---

  ### Level-1 
  ##### Initializing a local DHIS2 Application:
  ##### Application requirements:
    
       1. Should have: DHIS2 headbar
       2. Should display: Hello World!

  ##### Steps to follow:

   - Go to the level-1 application environment:
   ```bash
   cd level-1
   ```

  - To setup a dhis2 appliction development environment, run the following commands respectively: 
        ```
        d2 app scripts init .
        ``` 
        
      If you get an error, you might need to install d2 (read about [d2](https://github.com/dhis2/d2)) by running:
        ```
        yarn add d2
        ```
  - After setting up the application development environment, start to install node_modules by:
       ```
      yarn install
      ```
     then you might start the appplication by:
      ```
      yarn start
      ```

  - After starting the application, you need also a running DHIS2 server. 
  To start a DHIS2 server instance, run the following commands (in a new terminal window):

     ```
     dhis-portal --server=play --instance=2.34.1
     ```

    If you get an error or dhis-portal is not installed, run the following command and try to run the above command again:

     ```
     yarn global add dhis-portal
     ```
    
    For more info about the DHIS2 server instance: to start a DHIS2 server instance and login, please check [ref](https://www.fiftythreetwenty.com/learn/mandatory-exercises/individual/two/dhis2-instance/)

 - At this stage, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000, then proceed to login with 
   server *http://localhost:9999*, username *admin*, password  *district*
 - If logged-in, it means requirement #1 is completed ðŸŽ‰:
 - To complete requirement #2, change the existing application to display the following image.
  ![Hello_Wolrd!](./assets/hello_world.png)
- After displaying 'Hello World!' on your application, requirment #2 is completed ðŸŽ‰

- Finally, you can send your local changes to your online github repository: 

  - In the same directory of Level-1, **run** ```yarn test```
  - Now, you might need ```cd ..``` to get to the root directory:
    - add all of your changes by ```git add .```, 
    - commit it by ```git commit -m "commit message"``` and 
    - push the changes by ```git push```
